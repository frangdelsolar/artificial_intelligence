Genetic Algorithm implementation for solving Einstein's riddle
by Lic. Francisco Gonz√°lez del Solar

The application implements the creation of a population of solutions for this famous puzzle. 
It runs in cycles evaluatig the fitness of every proposed solution, and making small changes through generations, 
until it gets to the actual solution of the puzzle.
To do so, it creates a mating pool of candidates to be reproduce in each generation. The posibilities of reproducing depend on the fitness.

No requirements are needed to run the code.
Run the main file in python terminal.
